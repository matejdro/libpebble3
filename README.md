# libpebble3

libpebble3 is a kotlin multiplatform library for interacting with Pebble devices. It is designed to do everything that a Pebble/Core watch companion app needs to do, except for the UI and specific web services.

## Enabling PebbleKit Android 2

To fully enable PebbleKit Android 2 support, you have to add this provider to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<provider
    android:authorities="[YOUR_PACKAGE].pebblekit"
    android:name="io.rebble.libpebblecommon.pebblekit.two.PebbleKitProvider"
    android:exported="true" />
```

Where the `[YOUR_PACKAGE]` is the package name of your application.

## Enabling PebbleKit Android Classic

To fully enable PebbleKit Android Classic, you have to add this provider to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<providers
    android:authorities="com.getpebble.android.provider.basalt"
    android:name="io.rebble.libpebblecommon.pebblekit.classic.PebbleKitProvider"
    tools:ignore="ExportedContentProvider"
    android:exported="true" />
```

Note that by doing so, your app will not be able to be installed alongside other apps that also do this.

# Mobile App

The cross-platform Pebble mobile app is located in `composeApp`.

Compile on Android with `./gradlew :composeApp:assembleRelease`.
Compile on iOS in xcode (after running a gradle sync to generate project files).

You will need a GitHub username (`github.username`) and token (`github.token`) configured in `local.properties` to fetch the speex module.
You will need a `google-services.json` in `composeApp/src` to compile on Android (an examples with dummy values is provided in `google-services-dummy.json`).
You will need a `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `iosApp/iosApp` to compile on iOS.
You will need a keystore with some keys if you intend to do a release build on Android (unless you use `LOCAL_RELEASE_BUILD=true` in `gradle.properties`).

Several features (e.g. bug reporting, google login, memfault, online transcription, github developer connection) will not work without tokens configured in `gradle.properties` (but all core features do work).

### Naming your project

In order to honour the Pebble trademark, you may not use "Pebble" in the name of your app, product or service, except in a referential manner. For example, "Awesome App for Pebble" is acceptable, but "Pebble Awesome" is not.

# Contributing

We aren't actively encouraging contributions yet, while we are aggressively building out feature parity with the original Pebble apps. CI testing is not comprehensive, so changes need to be manually tested with real hardware using CoreApp, and our roadmap/bug tracker is not currently on github. We will update when this changes.

# Development Guidelines

(We don't follow all of these everywhere, yet, and need to document a lot more..)

- We share a version catalog with CoreApp to avoid duplicating definitions. This means a few extra library entries which are not used in libpebble (so they can share the version definition).
- Use `optIn` in `build.gradle.kts` rather than individual source files.
- Only use injected coroutine scopes: either LibPebbleCoroutineScope (instead of GlobalScope) or ConnectionCoroutineScope (scoped per-connection).

Connection:
- Services are scoped to the connection. Their main job is to translate raw pebble protocol messages to something readable by the rest of the app.
- Endpoint managers are also scoped to the connection, and manage complex state around services.
